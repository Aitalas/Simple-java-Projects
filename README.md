# Simple-java-Projects

Based on the list from: http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/

A series of simple projects for learning and review.

<h2>Completed</h2>

<b>Reverse a String</b> – Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

<b>Pig Latin</b> – Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

<b>Count Vowels</b> – Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

<strong class="bbc">Check if Palindrome</strong> – Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

<strong class="bbc">Count Words in a String</strong> – Counts the number of individual words in a string. For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a summary.

<strong class="bbc">Text Editor</strong> – Notepad style application that can open, edit, and save text documents. Add syntax highlighting and other features.

<h2>In Progress</h2>

RSS Feed Creator – A program which can read in text from other sources and put it in RSS or Atom news format for syndication.

Post it Notes Program – A program where you can add text reminders and post them. You can have the program also add popup reminders.

Quote Tracker (market symbols etc) – A program which can go out and check the current value of stocks for a list of symbols entered by the user. The user can set how often the stocks are checked and the program can show green up and red down arrows to show which direction the stock value has moved.

Guestbook / Journal – A simple application that allows people to add comments or write journal entries. It can allow comments or not and timestamps for all entries. Could also be made into a shout box.

News Ticker and Game Scores – A program which sits on your desktop and aggregates news and game scores from various sources on the net. It then scrolls them across the screen on regular intervals.
